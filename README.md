Developed and trained a neural network model using backpropagation to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. Leveraged Python libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib to preprocess and visualize the data, enabling clear insights into the model's performance and the dataset's characteristics.
